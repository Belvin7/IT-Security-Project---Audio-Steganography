# IT-Security-Project-Audio-Steganography
Concealing Images within Sound


This project explores the techniques and detection methodologies of audio steganography—the practice of concealing secret data or information within audio files. We explored the topic from two perspectives: that of an attacker who embeds secret information through discreet manipulations of audio components and the forensic analyst who works to expose such manipulations. The project imitated 1 attacks from 8 different devices, involving 4 distinct Alices (attackers). We generated, tested, and analyzed various stego-audio samples, using a range of tools like FFMPEG, SOX, PYTAI, Sherloq, and MP3 file structure analyser.

Through spectrogram and structural analysis, the study identified consistent patterns, including distortions in the high-frequency range and minor irregularities in the audio signal. We simulated multiple attack scenarios across different devices (‘Alices’), evaluating the effectiveness of the hidden communication as well as its vulnerability to forensic scrutiny.

The results help us better understand digital forensics and demonstrate how audio can serve as one of the means for a secret communication medium, posing both technical challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity related contexts.
